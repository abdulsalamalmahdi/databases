# Homework week 3

## Go through my Week3 Exercise, understand it, create something : Be Creative!
- Connect to your database as you were doing in class.
- Create the view madridcity with the madridcity.sql (you can use source or copy paste :P )
- Create the user you will use in the application (see create-user.sql even though you cannot user source there and you will have to do it)
- Open WeekExercise3 in your favourite IDE (Integrated Development Environment) such as Visual Studio code
- Change the database.js file to use the new created user (above)
- Run the app.js server to see that everything is running.
- Go through the examples that we saw. 
- Look at the repositories in the folder /modules/
- Look at the routing in the folder /routes/
- Try to add, edit, remove from the city table.
- Try to see the accounts table. Try to give yourself a good amount of money. 
- There are many exercises hidden in the code. Do them if you want to learn.
- Use your imagination.
